# Identity Service Design Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the complete design documentation for the Identity Service of the TiHoMo system.

## File Structure

### üìã Main Design Documents

#### `../identity-service.md`
- **Primary design document** - Complete and comprehensive design
- Contains all 4 phases: Basic Authentication, Refresh Token, Resilience Patterns, Monitoring & Observability
- Updated and merged from advanced implementation documents
- **This is the main file to reference**

#### `advanced-implementation.md`
- **Advanced features documentation** - Phases 3 & 4 detailed implementation
- Circuit breaker patterns, resilience strategies
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability design
- Production-ready improvements and optimizations

### üìÅ Supporting Documentation
- Additional implementation guides and reference materials
- Configuration examples and best practices
- Performance tuning and security hardening guides

## Architecture Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Authentication & Token Verification
- Social login integration (Google, Facebook, Apple)
- Stateless token verification through API Gateway
- Basic user management and database operations

### Phase 2: Refresh Token Management & Security Enhancement
- Automatic token refresh mechanisms
- Enhanced security with multi-layer validation
- User experience improvements for session management

### Phase 3: Resilience Patterns & Circuit Breaker Implementation
- Circuit breaker for external provider API calls
- Fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation
- Retry policies with exponential backoff

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Observability System
- Comprehensive metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Health checks and alerting systems

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- **Phase 1**: Basic authentication flow working
- **Phase 2**: Token refresh mechanisms implemented
- **Phase 3**: Resilience patterns with circuit breaker
- **Phase 4**: Full observability stack operational

### üîß Production Readiness
- Performance optimizations with caching strategies
- Security hardening with rate limiting
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Health check integration for deployment pipelines

## Update History
- **June 2025**: Merged advanced implementation (Phase 3-4) into main design document
- **June 2025**: Reorganized directory structure for Identity Service design files
- **June 2025**: Standardized format and structure according to project guidelines

## Notes
- All documentation follows format and structure according to `main.instructions.md`
- This design has been implemented and tested in development environment
- Phase 3 (Resilience) and Phase 4 (Observability) implementation completed
- Ready for production deployment with comprehensive monitoring
